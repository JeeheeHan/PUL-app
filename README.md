Pitch: 
Do you think plants have the same senses as a human being? Even dating back to 1966 there are experiments that a CIA polygraph expert hooked on stress level machine to an office plant (Dracaena). To his suprise, with just imagining burning the plant, the plant felt stress. In this internet webbed world we are in, I want to provide the same opportunity to virtually experiment with a plant using words. PUL is a web application that allows users to decide on complimenting or insulting your very own plant. With this virtual stimulation, I want to inspire to not only allow the user to get creative with words, but to understand the impact of positivity and negativity overall. Back in 2018, IKEA collected statements from children and played compliments to one plant and insults to another. Kids were able to visualize the impacts of words through the plants. The results were as shocking or expected to some. The plant receiving compliments thrived while the other did not. So I welcome you to utlizie the power of positivity or negativity and make an impact to your own virtual plant
